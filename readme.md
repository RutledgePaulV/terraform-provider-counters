A terraform provider for generating sequential values based on generic triggers.

---

## Provider

This provider is available from the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers).

```terraform 
terraform {
    required_providers = {
        counters = {
            source = "rutledgepaulv/counters"
        }
    }
}

provider counters {}
```

## Resources

Examples of supported resources are provided below.

- [Monotonic](#monotonic)
- [Semantic Version](#semantic-version)

---

#### Monotonic

Use this to produce a number which increments by step each time there's a change to any triggers.

```terraform
resource counters_monotonic this {
    step = 1
    initial_value = 0
    triggers = {
        hash = md5(jsonencode(something_else.this))
    }
}

resource downstream this {
    value = counters_monotonic.this.value
}
```

---

#### Semantic Version

Use this to produce a semantic version which increments by step each time there's a change to any triggers of the
relevant version component. When the major version changes, the minor and patch versions start over at zero. When the
minor changes, the patch version starts over at zero.

```terraform
resource counters_semantic_version this {
    minor_triggers = {
        hash = md5(jsonencode(something_else.this))
    }
    patch_triggers = {
        hash = md5(jsonencode(something_else.that))
    }
}

resource downstream this {
    value = counters_semantic_version.this.value
}
```
